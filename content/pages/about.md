      Founded in 2018, **cull.media** is a boutique digital agency built on
      creativity, strategy, and genuine relationships. We specialise in
      influencer marketing and content campaigns that actually move the
      needle—connecting brands with the right creators and audiences. As a small
      team, we’re hands-on with every project, taking pride in the details and
      delivering real results, every time.


      Over the past several years, influencer marketing has gone from niche to
      necessary. But in a crowded space where everyone’s chasing impressions, we
      focus on influence that actually converts. We don’t just look at follower
      counts—we dive deeper into audience quality, platform behavior, and brand
      alignment to make sure every partnership we activate has purpose.


      The content landscape is constantly evolving. Short-form formats dominate
      attention spans. Algorithms shift weekly. Audiences are more discerning
      than ever. In this climate, brands can’t afford to blend in. That’s why we
      build campaigns that are not only culturally relevant, but
      performance-driven—tailored to your goals, whether that’s awareness,
      engagement, or bottom-line impact.


      We’ve worked across industries—from DTC and consumer tech to wellness,
      fashion, and finance—building campaigns that feel human, not
      transactional. Our network of creators spans micro to macro, across
      TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, and emerging channels. And because we operate
      as an extension of your team, we don’t just drop names and move on—we
      manage every aspect: from sourcing and briefing to content approvals,
      comms, compliance, and reporting.


      We're obsessed with clarity and creativity in equal measure. That means
      clean processes, transparent communication, and standout storytelling.
      We’re also selective—about the creators we work with, the partnerships we
      take on, and the results we chase.
