For years, impressions were the holy grail of marketing reports. The bigger the number, the better the campaign — or so everyone thought. But here’s the truth: impressions alone don’t mean impact, engagement does. They tell you who *could* have seen your content, not who actually cared.

In influencer marketing, especially in 2025, the brands that win are the ones that look deeper. They’re tracking engagement — the likes, comments, watch time, click-throughs — because that’s where influence turns into action.



### Why Engagement Is the Real Currency

Think about it this way: a banner ad on a gaming livestream might get seen by thousands of people. But when the streamer pauses mid-match to answer questions about the product, that’s engagement. Viewers aren’t just noticing the brand; they’re interacting with it, processing it, and remembering it.

### Vanity Metrics vs. Valuable Metrics

Impressions are often “vanity metrics” — they look good in a report but don’t tell you much about actual ROI. Valuable metrics go deeper:

*   **Watch time** → Did the audience stick around to hear the message?

*   **Comments** → Did the content spark a conversation?

*   **Clicks** → Did curiosity turn into action?

*   **Conversions** → Did the campaign actually drive sign-ups or sales?

When we evaluate campaigns at Cull Media, these are the numbers that matter.

### Why Brands Still Chase Impressions

It’s easy to see why impressions are still overvalued: they’re simple, fast, and make slides look impressive in boardrooms. But in reality, chasing reach without engagement is like filling a stadium where nobody’s actually watching the game.

### What This Means for Brands

If your influencer campaign report only lists impressions, you’re not seeing the full picture. Brands that focus on engagement — whether through micro-influencers, interactive campaigns, or community-driven platforms like Discord — consistently see stronger ROI.

At **Cull Media**, we prioritize clarity and performance. That means cutting through vanity metrics and focusing on the signals that actually move the needle. Because at the end of the day, 10,000 people who care are more valuable than a million who scroll past.
