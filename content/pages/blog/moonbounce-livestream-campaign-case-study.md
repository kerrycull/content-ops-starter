**Moonbounce** has solidified itself in gaming culture over the years through various influencer campaigns showcasing its revolutionary web browser extension that combines gaming and internet browsing seamlessly. Recently, they launched a livestream overlay plugin that gives creators another way to incentivize their audiences to tune in.

The team behind Moonbounce are experts in community building, and with deep ties to online multiplayer games, their product was a perfect fit for streamers on Twitch and Kick alike. The goal wasn’t just visibility, it was to reach the right gaming communities and drive adoption quickly.

### Finding the Right Fit

Rather than blasting this out to dozens of random streamers, we focused on creators who:

*   Streamed regularly with OBS

*   Had strong communities around online games, and were active on multiple platforms

*   Were trusted voices who could introduce a new tool without it feeling like an ad

Within just **two weeks**, we sourced a shortlist of creators who fit the product perfectly.

### The Campaign in Motion

We worked closely with the creators and the brand to oversee the development of customized cosmetic rewards for viewers who became Moonbounce customers. These items would display on a user’s avatar once they completed a set of challenges in the application, creating an organic feedback loop that strongly incentivized participation.

Our role included:

*   Liaising with creators to ensure they had a voice in the creative process

*   Getting them set up with the plugin

*   Organizing a schedule for them to go live

*   Making sure the content was represented organically and aligned with the brand’s goals

Because it was creator-led, audiences didn’t just see a product — they saw it working in real time.

### The Results

Moonbounce’s livestream overlay was seen by thousands of viewers live on Twitch over multiple days, and the launch generated a wave of new users for the platform. Audiences across different gaming communities were exposed to a tool that aligned perfectly with their interests, making the campaign mutually beneficial for both brand and creator.

More importantly, Moonbounce’s product wasn’t just promoted, it was adopted by creators and their communities.

### Why This Worked

Looking back, three things made this campaign click:

1.  **Right creators, right audience** – we didn’t chase big names; we chased relevance.

2.  **Hands-on execution** – from setup help to content approvals, nothing slipped.

3.  **Authenticity** – creators weren’t just reading scripts; they were showing real use.

### Looking Forward

For us, this wasn’t just about a one-off activation. It was about helping Moonbounce carve out a place in the streaming ecosystem. The overlay reached the exact audience it was built for, and that’s what influencer marketing should do.
