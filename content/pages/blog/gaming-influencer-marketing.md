If you want to understand why gaming influencers matter right now, start with a Twitch chat on a Saturday night. Thousands of people from around the world are tuned in, spamming emotes, laughing at inside jokes, and hanging on every word their favorite streamer says. For a generation of gamers — especially guys aged 18–30 — this *is* the new “water cooler.” It’s where community lives.

And here’s the kicker: when that same streamer takes a sip of an energy drink, or mentions the headset they’re using mid-match, it doesn’t feel like an ad. It feels like a friend giving a recommendation. That’s the difference between traditional advertising and influencer marketing in gaming. One interrupts; the other integrates.

#### The trust factor in gaming

Gamers spend hours watching the same creators day after day. That builds trust — the kind of trust brands can’t buy with a billboard. According to industry research, gaming audiences watch **95+ minutes per day** on average, and that kind of time builds a relationship. When a creator says “this controller actually improved my aim,” fans don’t hear it as a sales pitch. They hear it as advice.

#### Why gaming is the perfect testing ground for brands

The gaming space moves fast. A meme can go viral in the middle of a stream, a new game can drop overnight, and an influencer can drive thousands of viewers to a Discord server in minutes. That real-time feedback loop makes gaming the ultimate lab for marketing campaigns. You know instantly what’s working and what isn’t — and you can pivot on the fly.

#### What this means for brands

If your target audience is young, digital-first, and hard to reach through traditional channels, gaming influencers are your MVPs. They bring credibility, authenticity, and an audience that *wants* to engage. For brands, this isn’t about slapping a logo on a livestream — it’s about co-creating experiences that feel like part of the game.

At **Cull Media**, we’re doubling down on gaming because it’s where culture is being shaped in real time. From helping publishers launch new titles to connecting lifestyle brands with esports personalities, we design campaigns that cut through the noise and drive real results.
