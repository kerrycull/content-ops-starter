        title: How do you choose which influencers to work with?
        subtitle: ''
        text: >
          We don’t just go by follower count. Our selection process considers
          audience demographics, engagement quality, content style, platform
          performance, and brand fit. Every creator is vetted manually—and if we
          don’t already have the right person in our network, we’ll go out and
          find them.

          Primarily YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and Twitch—but we’re flexible.
          If your audience is spending time somewhere else (like LinkedIn or
          emerging platforms), we’ll adapt. Our job is to meet your audience
          where they are, not force them into a platform strategy that doesn’t
          make sense.

          We manage campaigns end-to-end. That includes creator outreach,
          negotiations, briefing, approvals, tracking, and reporting. You’ll
          always have visibility, but we keep things off your plate so you can
          focus on the big picture.

          It depends on your goals. For awareness, we track reach, impressions,
          views, and engagement. For performance-focused campaigns, we look at
          clicks, signups, conversions, or any custom KPIs you care about. We
          also provide qualitative insights—because not everything that matters
          fits in a spreadsheet.

          We’ve worked with brands of all sizes—from early-stage startups to
          household names—across industries like lifestyle, wellness, tech,
          fashion, finance, and more. If you’re looking to build genuine creator
          relationships and run campaigns that actually perform, we’re probably
          a fit.
